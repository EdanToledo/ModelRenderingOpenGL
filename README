Compilation on linux:
1. Make sure the objects folder is inside the build folder
2. Make sure the shaders: "simple.vert" and "simple.frag" are in the build folder.
3. Make sure all libraries required are installed namely libsdl2-dev and libglew-dev.
4. To install these packages type sudo apt-get install <package name> in a terminal window and hit enter. 
5. Once the packages are installed, open a terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory. 
6. Use "make" to build your project and "make run" to run it. You should now see a window with a teapot in it.
7. Use controls above to manipulate the obj with the mouse. The default setting doesn't allow manipulation so click a button before trying to do anything
